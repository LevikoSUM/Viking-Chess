# What is Tafl (Viking Chess)
Tafl, or "Hnefatafl," is an ancient Nordic board game that predates chess and was popular in Viking-era Scandinavia. It is an asymmetric strategy game where one player controls a defending king and his guards, while the other controls a larger force of attackers. The goal of the game varies depending on the side:

Defenders: Escort the king to a corner of the board.
Attackers: Capture the king before he escapes.
