# What is Tafl (Viking Chess)
Tafl, or "Hnefatafl," is an ancient Nordic board game that predates chess and was popular in Viking-era Scandinavia. It is an asymmetric strategy game where one player controls a defending king and his guards, while the other controls a larger force of attackers. The goal of the game varies depending on the side:

**Defenders**: Escort the king to a corner of the board.

**Attackers**: Capture the king before he escapes.

# Rules

-All pieces move like a rook in chess: any number of squares in a straight line (vertically or horizontally), but not diagonally.

-Pieces cannot jump over other pieces.

-Only the king can move in the corners and the central square, which is called a throne.

-To capture a piece you need to surround it on two opposite sides (not the diagonals), the king needs to be surrounded on all four unless he is on the edge of the board then it needs only three sides.

-The corners and the throne count as pieces when capturing.
